# GTK3 Rust bindings are unmaintained — the entire gtk-rs GTK3 ecosystem
# (gtk, gdk, glib, atk, cairo-rs, pango, gdk-pixbuf, gio) has been superseded
# by GTK4 bindings. Migration to gtk4 is tracked but not feasible for v0.1.0
# since tray-icon/muda/libappindicator still depend on GTK3.
#
# The glib unsoundness (GHSA-wrw7-89jp-8q8g) affects VariantStrIter which
# this project does not use.
